# CSAT-Excel-Sorting
Retrieves Customer SATisfaction survey results from a specific excel sheet and creates a much prettier version
There is an example Excel workbook (the ePoll CSAT sheet) to pull data from.  This one has been heavily modified 
to make sure that there are:
    -NO tech names (other than myself)
    -NO original customer names
    -NO real site names
    -NO real services
    -NO real queues
    -NO real tickets
..and so on.  

I wanted to make sure that any proprietary information was removed, so it can be shown as an example of my work.
